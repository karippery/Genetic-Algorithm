# Genetic-Algorithm
#### implement all genetic algorithm operator  on python 
Here is try to implement a simple and Basic genetic Algorithm operator code. you should modify basiced on your population. 
in my code my population look like this 

``` 
  array ([[12, 52, 12, 49, 37, 11, 24, 51, 31, 58, 34, 50, 17, 10, 15],

         [23, 27, 33, 37, 53, 28, 34, 37, 34, 59, 31, 37, 11, 26, 46],

         [27, 34, 43, 41, 24, 37, 58, 19, 46, 32, 23, 10, 47, 48, 25],

         [42, 22, 32, 54, 58, 14, 56, 36, 58, 59, 10, 31, 25, 15, 20],

         [56, 29, 23, 54, 43, 36, 37, 37, 29, 42, 56, 16, 45, 50, 54],

         [55, 33, 14, 20, 47, 24, 22, 22, 43, 16, 30, 49, 17, 24, 11],

         [28, 36, 55, 54, 13, 21, 28, 56, 21, 29, 36, 48, 51, 47, 28]])
